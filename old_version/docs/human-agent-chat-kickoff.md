# HumanAgentChat - Claude Code Project Kickoff

We're building HumanAgentChat, a reusable Node.js chat UI npm package component with HTMX integration designed for human-AI collaboration. This component will be backed by Firebase services (Firestore, Storage, and Authentication) and feature a flexible, hierarchical access control system. The core strength of this component is its elegant simplicity: it uses a consistent pattern of members collections to control access at any level in a path hierarchy, making it highly adaptable for various use cases from organization-wide communication to small group collaborations. 

The component will support multi-modal content (text, images, videos), AI agent integration, document sharing, and interactive forms generated dynamically from Zod schemas. Rather than being a React component, this will be a server-rendered solution using HTMX for dynamic updates and interactivity without requiring a full SPA framework. The design will be dark-themed by default with a clean, modern interface that displays Firebase Auth user avatars (or generated initials).

The project should include examples of simple, one-to-many, and many-to-many chat scenarios in the `/examples` folder for testing and demonstration purposes. These example templates and any documentaiton examples should use Pug templates with Express and HTMx for the UI. The Zod-based form generation will also be a key feature, allowing for dynamic creation of interactive forms that can be displayed as modals or inline within the chat interface. Please use the open-source ZodForm npm package we designed for this purpose: `npm install git+https://github.com/oftomorrowinc/zod-form.git#v1.0.0` If you need any updates to the pacakge, just let us konw.

Please implement this based on the detailed specification in the project's root markdown document, focusing on creating an opinionated yet flexible Node.js chat component that enables effective collaboration between humans and AI agents through a simple, performant interface.
